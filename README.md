# Welcome!
Here are some example Guilded bots using [Guilded4J](https://github.com/MCUmbrella/Guilded4J) as library. You can find inspiration from them and then design a bot of your own, or use them as a basis for some changes. You can also contribute your own examples to this repo.
# Catalog
- **bot1**: Remove messages that contains specified content (such as 'sus'). It asks you to enter auth token at start.
- **bot2**: Show your system's resource usage (CPU, memory) in a channel. It has a config file.
- **bot3**: Simple ping-pong bot. The token is hardcoded.
- **bot4**: Send 1 to 10 in synchronous and asynchronous mode. It's meant to indicate that Guilded4J sends HTTP requests in the current thread by default.
